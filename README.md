# monopoly-bank

Do you find that using Monopoly money takes too much time? Do you get sick of having to ask for change so you can pay rent to other players? What about that friend who you suspect is stealing from the Bank?

After playing Monopoly for many years, I decided to revolutionise our gameplay experience by building a simple yet effective website that looks after the funds of each player and the Bank. This not only cut down our game duration, but also provides a 'transaction log' so everything is open for all to see (so you can catch out that friend of yours!).

Features:
* Supports 3 players
* Additional fourth player for Free parking (if you wish to play with the 'fines go to Free Parking variant')
* Can set player names
* Full transaction log
* Can specify starting amounts for each player
* Low funds alerts
* Prevents transactions where the debitor has insufficient funds
* ...

Enjoy!
